# PROMPT — `@hms/contracts`

**Read [`.github/AGENT_PROMPT.md`](../../.github/AGENT_PROMPT.md) first.** It holds
the rules, the stack, the file shape, and the definition of done. This file holds
only what is specific to `packages/contracts`.

**Read [`.github/RULES.md`](../../.github/RULES.md) too.** It is binding.

Every backend service imports this package. A bug here is a bug in eight places at
once, which is why the test bar is higher here than in a service.

---

## What this package owns

The wire format. zod schemas that produce runtime validation, the TypeScript
request and response types, client-side form validation, and the OpenAPI document
— all from one declaration. A contract change fails CI in every consumer at once,
which is the entire point.

## State: built, 66 tests

The error envelope, the role enum, and pagination exist and are in use by
`identity`.

## What to build

1. **Domain schemas as services need them** — but only once a **second** consumer
   appears. A schema used by one service belongs in that service.
2. **OpenAPI generation** from the zod schemas, so the document cannot drift from
   the code. A hand-written OpenAPI file drifts within a month.
3. Keep the error envelope and the error code table authoritative. A service that
   invents its own error shape breaks every client's error handling.

## Rules specific to this package

- Treat every change as breaking until proven otherwise. Adding an optional field
  is safe; nearly nothing else is.
- No service-specific logic. This package describes shapes, it does not decide
  anything.

## Definition of done

The full checklist is in [`.github/AGENT_PROMPT.md`](../../.github/AGENT_PROMPT.md)
section 5. A package has no Postman collection and no Dockerfile, so the bar is
higher instead on two things:

1. **Tests.** Every service depends on this code. Test the edges and the failures,
   not the happy path.
2. **The README.** It is the only documentation a service developer reads before
   using this package. Show the actual call, not a description of it.

`pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm typecheck:tests`,
`pnpm format:check` and `pnpm test` must all pass, and the matching rows in
[`RECORD.md`](../../.github/RECORD.md) must be updated in the same commit.

## What you may change

This package, and the shared configuration it genuinely needs: `envs/.env.example`
and `envs/CATALOGUE.md` for key names, and `scripts/dev/*` for a helper that does
not exist yet.

Name every out-of-package edit in the pull request description. BHUVNESH reviews
all of them and needs to see the shared-file changes without hunting.

## Do not

- **Write a real secret value anywhere.** Placeholders only, no exceptions.
- **Edit `.github/workflows/`, `CODEOWNERS`, `RULES.md`, or `AGENT_PROMPT.md`.**
  Those decide what gets merged and what the rules are. Propose changes instead
  of making them.
- **Edit `infra/helm/`, `infra/terraform/`, or `infra/kubernetes/`.**
- Add a dependency without asking. Seven other services inherit it.
- Break an existing export. Every service imports this package.
- Put anything service-specific in here. If only one service needs it, it belongs
  in that service.
- Weaken or delete a test to make a build pass.
